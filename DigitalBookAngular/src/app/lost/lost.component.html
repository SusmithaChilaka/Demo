          <h3>Lost and Wanted</h3>
          <p>Lost and Wanted is a searing novel from one of America's most exciting writers about the knottiness of female friendship, the forces which fuse us together and those which drive us apart.</p>
          <p>Helen Clapp is a physics professor. She doesn't believe in pseudo-science, or time travel and especially not in ghosts. So when she gets a missed call from Charlie, her closest friend from university with whom she hasn't spoken in over a year, Helen thinks there must be some mistake. Because Charlie died two days ago.

            Then when her young son, Jack, claims to have seen Charlie in their house just the other day, Helen begins to have doubts.</p>
